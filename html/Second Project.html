     <p><b>C</b>losing in on 50 million units sold, it's safe to say Sony's PlayStation 4
       has been a huge success, significantly outpacing its closest competition,
       Microsoft's Xbox One. But just three years since its debut, Sony has released
       a hardware step-up model of the PS4, aptly called the PlayStation 4 Pro.
       As you can guess by the name, this isn't the PlayStation 5. It's fully
       compatible with all of the existing games, apps and nearly all the PS4
       accessories currently on the market (or in your personal collection).
       The new model hit stores on November 10 for $399 in the US, AU$559 in
       Australia and 38,990 Rupees in India.</p>

            <p>There's not much difference between the PS4 Pro and the original PS4.
              As the difference lies in size and some of its improvement as it's
              few centimeters bigger in every direction. Despite these problems
              sony nails the fundamentals with the ps4 hardware.It's bigger and
              also gained weight as we compare it with the previous model of ps4
              and other gaming consoles. It's similar around the back with the
              same HDMI, Ethernet, digital optical audio and playstation camera
              ports.The HDMI ports does get a boost to 4K.</p>

            </div>

                <p>The DualShock 4 is the best controller Sony has ever made. It's
                better than DualShock 3 and the controller is little bit heavier
                and is little bit bigger. The DualShock 4 is appealing not just
                to the eye but, more importantly, to the hands.</p>

             <ul>
               <li><b>BUTTONS</b></li>
             </ul>

                  <p>Buttons are buttery smooth and feels great while playing, Share
                  and option buttons are too far away. As the share button lets
                  players to record and upload videos and screenshots to the web.</p>
           <ul>
              <li><b>TOUCHPAD</b></li>
            </ul>

               <p>The Toucpad is improved and is placed on the front of the controller
                and we did discover that it acts like a button itself and is a
                clickable 2-point touchpad with a resolution of 1920x900. The
                functionality of the touchpad will differ from between games.you
                are able to zoom, swipe, pinch, and scroll with the intuitive
                touchpad.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><b>GRIP</b></li>
              </ul>

                 <p>The quality of the DualShock 4 is great as the grip can be seen
                 on both the back of the controller and on the analog sticks. The
                 texture and polishing is nice and is comfortable while playing
                 games.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><b>ANALOG STICKS</b></li>
              </ul>

                  <p>Sony has replaced the DualShock 3's inwardly-curving triggers
                  with triggers that curve outward. Analog sticks are more better
                  and are improved.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><b>BATTERY</b></li>
              </ul>

                  <p>The DualShock 4 comes with a lithium-ion rechargeable battery
                  and charges using a micro USB, but many reviews note the
                  DualShock 4 has a battery life of roughly 7-8 hours. The DualShock 4
                  battery isn't intended to be replaced.</p>

             <P>The big news here is that unlike the Microsoft Xbox One S,
                the PS4 Pro doesn't have a 4K Blu-ray drive - which
                obviously means you won't be able to watch UHD Blu-rays
                on it. It'll still play 1080p discs, but stick in a 4K
                Blu-ray and it'll just comes up as "Unsupported" on the
                home screen. Sony's reasoning for omitting one? The world's
                moved on; streaming services such as Netflix are more popular
                than buying discs. It's a fair point, but given Microsoft
                managed to squeeze one into the One S, it's still a
                disappointment that the more expensive PS4 Pro doesn't
                have one too. You do get 4K video, though, through the
                usual suspects - or at least you should do by launch.
                Netflix is already running in 4K, and YouTube will get
                there by launch too, but there's no HDR streaming on
                Netflix or Amazon just yet. This is kind of a moot point
                for most 4K TV owners, though. Their TVs should already
                have UHD-ready Amazon, Netflix and YouTube apps, just like
                our Samsung and Philips test screens do. The upshot is
                that while The PS4 Pro may offer the best console gaming
                experience, it doesn't offer quite the best home
                entertainment experience; you'll need another box for that.</p>

                <p>Have you somehow managed to buy all 700+ PS4 games released
                  so far? No, thought not. But whatever is currently in your
                  collection will play nicely on PS4 Pro. It'll upscale all of
                  those games to 4K resolution, too. The real difference comes
                  with games that have been optimised for PS4 Pro.</p>

                <p>It's one major advantage that the PS4 Pro has over the Xbox
                  One S. Because the Pro has more power as opposed to just
                  gaining 4K capabilities as the Xbox did, those fully optimised
                  games will look better than anything you can play on Microsoft's
                  console. The One S does have a handful of its own 'optimised'
                  games, but these are optimised only for HDR rather than
                  performance. Developers can choose how they take advantage of
                  the improved performance, either bumping the resolution,
                  increasing frame rates, adding more detailed textures, or a
                  combination of all three.</p>

                <p>The emphasis on powerful hardware dedicated to gaming
                  software is already yielding tangible advantages over the
                  competition, with games like Battlefield 4 running in higher
                  resolution on the PlayStation 4 than the Xbox One. However,
                  at launch, the PS4 has failed to muster a software library

                <p>The PS4 Pro's heftier internals also give PlayStation VR a
                  boost. Developers can again choose how to use that power,
                  either bumping resolution, adding more effects, or improving
                  the anti-aliasing. In theory, these improvements will make
                  your games more immersive, but it's tricky when you can't
                  compare them side-by-side. The PSVR's display isn't getting
                  any extra pixels, either.</p>

                  <p>The biggest problem with PSVR? Its processing box doesn't
                    support 4K or HDR, so you have to manually swap over the
                    cables every time you switch between VR headset and TV. It
                    feels anything but "Pro".</p>


                <p>The PS4 Pro will launch with Netflix support at 4K resolution
                   in addition to a YouTube app with 4K and HDR compatibility.
                   More apps will open up support for 4K and HDR features as the
                   platform matures. Also exclusive to the PS4 Pro is improved
                   bandwidth for the Remote Play and Share Play options,
                   which let you stream gameplay over the internet. Both modes
                   will be able to share, stream and play at 1080p, which is a
                   bump up from the standard PS4's 720p cap</p>

                <P>But the PlayStation 4's focus on gaming - and only gaming -
                  is undermined by a distinct lack of compelling software.
                  That failing is sure to improve - better games and more of
                  them will appear on the PlayStation 4 - but right now, this
                  is a game console without a game to recommend it. Early
                  adopters of the PS4 this fall are buying potential energy.
                  We're just waiting for a place to spend it.</P>


            <h3>Let's face it - PS4 Pro is a beast.</h3>

                <p><b>The Good-</b> The <strong>PS4 Pro</STRONG> outputs a 4k-HDR
                  signal that's compatible with high-end TVs, and promises
                  better visuals and increased frame rates for certain games.
                  The console includes a 1TB hard drive, and kept works with all
                  ps4 games, apps and accessories to date.</p>

               <p><b>The Bad-</b> Out of the gate, only a handful of titles offer
                  dramatic improvements. In reality, most games that support Pro
                  enhancements don't offer a drastic difference in quality when
                  comparing standard and Pro games side-by-side. Specific
                  information on game improvements can be shoddy. The PS4 Pro
                  does not play Ultra HD 4K Blu-ray discs</p>

               <p><b>The Bottom-</b> Line The PlayStation 4 Pro only shows
                  noticeable improvements in a limited number of the games we were
                  able to test, but that could change with titles coming in the
                  months and years ahead.</p>

            <div class="line">
              <p><strong>Ultimately, the PS4 Pro is a system for console gamers
                  who have a 4K TV and want the best gaming experience possible.
                  If you meet these criteria, it's a must-buy.</strong></p>
